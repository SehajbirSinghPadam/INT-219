            <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>
            <p>It's important to start by clarifying to customers that your order processing times are separate from the shipping times they see at checkout.</p>
            <p>All orders are processed within X to X business days (excluding weekends and holidays) after receiving your order confirmation email. You will receive another notification when your order has shipped.</p>
            <p>Include any other pertinent information towards the beginning, such as potential delays due to a high volume of orders or postal service problems that are outside of your control.</p>

            <h2>Domestic Shipping Rates and Estimates</h2>
            <p>For calculated shipping rates: Shipping charges for your order will be calculated and displayed at checkout.</p>
            <p>For simple flat rate shipping: We offer $X flat rate shipping to [list countries].</p>
            <p>You can also emphasize any free shipping thresholds you offer (e.g. free shipping for orders over $75). For multiple shipping options, you can list carrier options, prices, and delivery times in a table.</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Shipping option</th>
                    <th>Estimated delivery time</th>
                    <th>Price</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Option 1</td>
                    <td>X to X business days</td>

            <h2>Local Delivery</h2>
            <p>If you offer local delivery or in-store pickup to customers in your area, you can dedicate a section of your shipping policy page to explain the process or create a separate shipping page specifically for local customers.</p>
            <p>Free local delivery is available for orders over X within [area of coverage]. For orders under X, we charge X for local delivery.</p>
            <p>Deliveries are made from [delivery hours] on [available days]. We will contact you via text message with the phone number you provided at checkout to notify you on the day of our arrival.</p>
            <p>You can list out the ZIP/postal codes you service and/or consider embedding a map here so customers can easily see if they are within your local delivery range.</p>

            <h2>In-Store Pickup</h2>
            <p>You can skip the shipping fees with free local pickup at [list the locations where in-store pickup is available]. After placing your order and selecting local pickup at checkout, your order will be prepared and ready for pick up within X to X business days. We will send you an email when your order is ready along with instructions.</p>

            <p>If relevant you can also include countries you don’t ship to: At this time, we do not ship to [list of countries].</p>
            <p>If you’re using calculated shipping rates: Shipping charges for your order will be calculated and displayed at checkout.</p>
            <p>If you offer multiple international shipping options, you can list them in a table as well. You can include broader delivery timelines (e.g. 8 to 20 days) for international shipping since expectations can vary greatly depending on the destination.</p>
